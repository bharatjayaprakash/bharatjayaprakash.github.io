I, along with [Shashi Shekhar](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/shashi-shekhar) and my colleague Mingzhou Yang, gave a guest lecture at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities campus, on the importance of physics in the age when everyone is crazy about AI. The lecture was part of the Emerge Summer STEM program - a free 4-week summer program for incoming PES students focused on STEM exploration, community building, and academic preparation as they begin their journey at the University of Minnesota. We delve into questions about the environmental effects of transportation and using data to mitigate the ill-effects. Topics covered were - eco-routing, eco-driving, and vehicle big data.
