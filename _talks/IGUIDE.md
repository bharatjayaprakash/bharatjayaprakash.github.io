I gave a talk on my published article titled '[Towards Carbon-Aware Spatial Computing: Challenges and Opportunities](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/iguide/2023/presentations/14/)' at the [I-GUIDE Forum 2023](https://iguide.illinois.edu/forum-2023/), hosted by Columbia University, NY. The Forum's theme was 'Harnessing the Geospatial Data Revolution for Sustainability Solutions'. 

In the talk, I explore the transformative potential of Carbon-Aware Spatial Computing (CASC). The article delves into how CASC can significantly reduce carbon emissions across various sectors, offering innovative solutions like carbon-smart site selection and supply chain development. The article underscores the urgent need for expanding research in this vital area, highlighting both the challenges and immense opportunities for societal impact.

Abstract: Carbon-aware spatial computing (CASC) is focused on reducing the carbon footprint of spatial computing itself and leveraging spatial computing techniques to minimize carbon emissions in other domains. The significance of CASC lies in its potential to mitigate anthropogenic climate change by offering numerous societal applications, such as carbon-aware supply chain development and carbon-aware site selection. CASC is challenging because of the spatiotemporal variability and the high dimensionality of carbon emissions data, involving spatial coordinates and timestamps. Related work, known as carbon-aware computing, mostly focuses on job scheduling of cloud computing, and there is a lack of surveys and review papers detailing the potential of CASC on variant domains and applications. In this paper, we provide the vision of CASC by proposing a taxonomy of sub-domains within CASC and introducing ideas beyond job scheduling, such as carbon-smart site selection. We also briefly review the literature in selected sub-domains and highlight research challenges and opportunities. Given the societal importance of the topic, we encourage the scientific community to use this brief survey to expand the field of study into other related sub-domains and advance CASC more broadly.
