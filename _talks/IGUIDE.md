I gave a talk on my published article titled '[Towards Carbon-Aware Spatial Computing: Challenges and Opportunities](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/iguide/2023/presentations/14/)' at the [I-GUIDE Forum 2023](https://iguide.illinois.edu/forum-2023/), hosted by Columbia University, NY. The Forum's theme was 'Harnessing the Geospatial Data Revolution for Sustainability Solutions'. 

In the talk, I explore the transformative potential of Carbon-Aware Spatial Computing (CASC). The article delves into how CASC can significantly reduce carbon emissions across various sectors, offering innovative solutions like carbon-smart site selection and supply chain development. The paper underscores the urgent need for expanding research in this vital area, highlighting both the challenges and immense opportunities for societal impact.
