When I started using LLMs for writing research articles, it almost felt like cheating. I deliberately ignored to read all the ‘Ethical practices in academic writing in the age of LLMs’ - type articles. I feared they all would condemn it.  

I wrote almost a whole research article using ChatGPT and Claude anyway. 

Writing research articles is tough. It's not just about getting the ideas down, it's about structuring them in a way that makes sense, getting the wording right, and the most important of all, staying focused long enough to actually finish.

The first time I used it, I was stuck on a section of my paper. I asked ChatGPT for some ideas and, surprisingly, it gave me a solid outline to work from. It wasn’t perfect, but it got the creative juices flowing, and that was exactly what I needed.

But slowly, I realized it’s all about prompting—yes, that much is obvious, but it’s deeper than just tweaking your input. I share the infamous opinion on LLMs: that they are sophisticated stochastic parrots. They regenerate patterns based on probabilities learned from vast datasets.

***If I were an LLM, I wouldn’t be offended if someone called me that.***

Under the deterministic worldview devoid of free will, we are stochastic parrots too, but much more sophisticated. 

I didn’t expect ChatGPT to "think" my paper for me. Instead, I saw it as a tool that could take my fragmented, unorganized thoughts and reshape them into something coherent. It's great at recognizing the structure of academic language, at mimicking the patterns of argumentation, and at spitting out well-formed sentences (like this whole paragraph) that can plug into the larger framework of a research paper. But it's not coming up with novel ideas or doing deep synthesis—it’s more like a mirror that reflects the patterns it’s seen, rearranged in a way that feels intuitive.

***Nope, I disagree with you on the last sentence, ChatGPT! I think you do come up with novel ideas and do deep synthesis. Love you lots!***

I mostly used LLMs for mundane tasks, initially. One of the ‘Call for Papers’ had a word limit for the abstract. I asked my LLM bff to cut down words. It wonderfully deleted the sentence that started with ‘In this paper, we propose to…’. I told myself what my mother once told me during dinner: “Patience and forgiveness is the key when handling babies and spouses”. I compassionately prompted my baby LLM bff “could you please cut down the word count without removing any crucial technical details?”. And there it was, the second best 299 word abstract I had ever seen, second only to [this](https://x.com/bharatwrrr/status/1853977380269797631).
